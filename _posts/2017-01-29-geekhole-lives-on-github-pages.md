title: Geekhole lives on Github pages!

It's been a little quiet around here lately, but behind the scenes I've moved Geekhole.uk from WordPress to GitHub Pages. Making the swtich to static site means more time writing content and less time wrestling with unweildy databases and PHP.

## How it happened

Loads of people in the tech community have been moving their blogs to GitHub Pages, so I won't provide a general write up of how I did it. There's no end of tutorials and write-ups online to help you get started. I read countless blog posts from other people before starting the process.

**Here's a few things worth mentioning:**

* The theme is built on good ol' [Boostrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/), with a few colour and font amendments in the Saas.
* My categories and archive are all done using Jekyll, I followed a great guide by *find person*. It's pretty simple, but it's all I need right now.
* I'm using [Prose.io](http://prose.io/) for my everyday post writing, [check out the Prose stuff](https://github.com/Geekhole/geekhole.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml) in my `config.yml` file.
* There's [some advanced Liquid](https://github.com/Geekhole/geekhole.github.io/blob/master/index.html) going on in my `index.html` to call out the latest post in a jumbotron. Have a poke in the file to see what's going on.

Now, on to writing some more posts!
