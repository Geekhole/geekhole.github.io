title: Geekhole lives on Github pages!

It's been a little quiet around here lately, but behind the scenes I've moved Geekhole.uk from WordPress to GitHub Pages. Making the swtich to static site means more time writing content and less time wrestling with unweildy databases and PHP.

## How the magic happened

Loads of people in the tech community have been moving their blogs to GitHub Pages, so I won't provide a general write up of how I did it. There's no end of tutorials and write-ups online to help you get started. I read countless blog posts from other people before starting the process.
